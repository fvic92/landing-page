Project: Landing Page | CSS Foundations (Flexbox) | Foundations Course

This project is my second web project, which was done as part of the Foundations Course of the Odin Project Curriculum, 
where I mainly practiced and showcased my CSS skills, using and understanding flexbox layouts and making websites with flexible and responsive layouts.

Beside CSS skills, I updated knowledge of the skills learned in an earlier project, such as HTML skills, working with files and all git-related skills.
